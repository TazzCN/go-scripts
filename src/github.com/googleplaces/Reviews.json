I got the chicken stir fry and was able to have some of the beef brisket noodle soup.\n\nBoth were a good sized portion and very filling. The beef brisket noodles were fantastic. Great deep and rich broth and the meat was lovely and tender.\n\nThis place is cash only by the way but there is an ATM close by.",

Reasonably priced compared to other hotels and AirBNBs.\n\nFor a one or two-night stay, this is exactly what you need which are the bare essentials.\n\nIt had a good-sized bed for two people. One criticism is that my room it didn't have a bedside table on one side of the bed. It's understandable because the room probably doesn't have enough space to fit everything.\n\nWould stay again for a day trip to Glasgow!",

        "Review Comment": "WORLD CLASS\n\nMade a booking for 2 people on a Saturday. It wasn't too busy so you could try and walk in. It got quite busy at like 8-9. Top notch service throughout our meal.\n\nWe started off with a lobster bisque. There were these very delectable kale chips on top which were nicely crisped and salted. The bisque itself was lovely. It was very creamy and had the most delightful seafood taste running throughout with the occasional morsel of lobster.\n\nThen for the mains I got the Halibut which was awesome! Everything worked so well together on the plate. There were the purees which are always great to add a little more to each other element. You could taste how quality the Halibut was with each bite. My favourite though was the potatoes on the side. It was like a next level mashed potatoes and was really creamy, garlicy, and flavourful.\n\nI tried a litte of the patridge. Loved what was done with the mushrooms and potatoes on that dish.\n\nWe ended with the lavender creme brulee which was amazing. It had the necessarily crispy top and was just the right amount of sweet.\n\nLoved my meal here and will definitely  be back as I imagine every dish on the menu is a winner",

From what I could see there was only one lady working there and she was very friendly. The second time we came in she gave us some free coffee and dessert!\n\nThe food was amazing. We just got three portions of whatever was being served which was an amazing selection of Ethiopian dishes on some lovely injera. All of the dishes  were full of flavour and worked really well together. It wasn't too spicy but just enough to provide that kick that you need\n\nFrom what I remember the meal was well priced.\n\nGreat break from Spanish cuisine  if you need one.",

We had someone that spoke French fluently so it was easy for us to order.\n\nWe got some small plates of fries and salad. We were about to be brought a plate for each of the members of our party. But we thought it would be too much. We should have taken them all because the fries were so crispy and morish. The salad was also great as the freshness was a nice break to cut through the richness of the meat.\n\nWe had the lamb tangia and then roast lamb. The lamb tagine was superb. A lovely undertone of lemon ran throughout which was a great addition to the tender lamb. The grilled lamb was spectacular. All the meats were to tender that they were falling all the bone. An extremely delicious and indulgent meal.\n\nFor six people the meal came to about £18 which was great value for money\n\nWill be recommending this place to anyone who visits marrakech.",

        "Review Comment": "INDULGENT SUGARY GOODNESS\n\nCame here around 9pm on a bank holiday. It was pretty quiet and we easily got a table for 3 people. One thing I would like to see in Edinburgh is more places that are open late that serve food and its cool to see places like this that are open past 10pm.\n\nWe got the 'I Won't Tell If You Won't' which is super heavy. I'm not sure how a single person is meant to finish it and carry on with their day. It was amazingly chocolatey. The crepes were fairly warm and the strawberries weren't as fresh as I would\nd have liked. It didn't matter though cause it was drowned out by the rich Belgian milk chocolate sauce.\n\nIt was quite late and there weren't that many people so the staff were cleaning up which is why we had to flag down staff at some points to get what we needed.\n\nI enjoyed the dessert I had and the place looked cool. Excited to go back here when I need a sweet treat at the end of the day.",

It's a cozy and friendly cafe.\n\nThe pancakes were some of the best I've had in Edinburgh! They were light and fluffy with the perfect amount of sweetness to them. The berries were a great addition to cut through the sweetness of the pancakes.\n\nI'm definitely coming back here to try out more of what's on offer!",

        "Review Comment": "ALL AROUND AMAZING\n\nCame here on a Saturday afternoon at around opening time with no reservation. The restaurant wasn't busy, so we got a table without any problems for two people. The service was on point and we were checked upon frequently by the staff. The food came out relatively quickly at no cost to the quality of the dishes.\n\nWe started with the highly recommended beef skewers which had a beautiful caramelised and smoky outside with a juicy inside. I would 100% get this again when I return. We also got the cucumber salad which was perfectly fresh and flavourful to cut through the saltiness and richness of all the meat dishes.\n\nFor the mains, we got the braised beef masaman curry which was spectacular. The curry was sweet and rich with the beef just falling apart with tenderness. The potatoes were a great accompaniment as they had absorbed all the curry goodness.\n\nEvery dish that we got was high quality, full of flavours and just amazing!\n\nThis was one of the best meals that I've had in Glasgow and I can't wait to go again. I'm looking forward to its opening in Edinburgh soon!",

        "Review Comment": "PHENOMENAL PASTA\n\nEasily managed to walk in on a Friday afternoon although soon after it was getting fairly busy. The staff were super efficient and our food came out quickly. It's quite a cool place because from my table I could see the pasta being made and the ravioli being stuffed. I haven't been to a place with such an open kitchen and so it's interesting to see the steps of how your food is made.\n\nWe got two dishes which were shared and a plate of bread to scoop up the sauces at the bottom. It was definitely needed cause there is so much flavour in the sauces.\n\nI started off with the Squid ink spaghetti with the monkfish. I could taste the quality and freshness of the pasta in each bite. The fish tasted nice and there was a lovely subtle chilli tomato flavour throughout.\n\nI also had a portion of the mushroom ravioli in a truffle butter sauce. It was an amazingly tasty and filling pasta bathed in the lovely decadent sauce. I still think about the richness of this pasta from time to time.\n\nWhen I go back to Glasgow I'm coming back here first!",

Each of the staff were really friendly and one of the chefs even came to the table to see how our meal went.\n\nTo get the range of dim sum, we got both the deep fried platter and the seafood platter. Each piece was beautifully crispy.\n\nI got the beef rendang rolls which were fantastic. Again amazingly crispy with a rich and tender beef filling.\n\nThe most enjoyable thing about this place is the variety of dishes that you can get which allow you to experience a lot of different, tasty and fresh flavours. Everything thing including the prawn laksa and nasi lemak ayam were fantastic.",

It was fairly busy when we arrived so would definitely recommend booking. Amarone had a relaxing environment and a nice decor. The service was great with the waiters checking in every so often and accomodating some extra requests.\n\nThe starters were beautiful! The fried mozzarella sticks were indulgent with a lovely crispy coating and a soft cheesy inside. The prawns were perfectly cooked and were bathed in a tasty buttery sauce. I also had the bruschetta which had nice crunchy bread and fresh tomatoes.\n\nI got the rigatoni pasta for mains. The ricotta, sausage, and tomato sauce all melded together to make a luxurious creamy sauce which made each bite extremely morish!\n\nBread had to be requested for the table so that the sauces from the pasta and starters could be scooped up. Definitely needed because all the sauces were so delicious.\n\nI got the creme brulée for dessert and they made it fantastically with a crispy sweet top and creamy base. Although I probably wouldn't order it again as I'm personally not a fan of the lime tones throughout.\n\nOverall, I had a great meal with great service and I can't wait to go again!",

        "Review Comment": "ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING\n\nI booked a table for two on a Friday at 6pm. This was one of the only times on that day that was available. After being seated we were given bread which had a lovely crunchy crust and tasted great. The waitress made us feel very welcome and comfortable.\n\nThis restaurant does one of my favourite things which is having an ever changing menu depending on the season and ingredients they have in.\n\nTo start off, we got the Mackerel with a caper remoulade. The fish was so fresh and delicate with a beautiful subtle salty taste. The creamy remoulade was also fresh and crunchy, and thus paired excellently with the slices of fish.\n\nFollowing that, I got the Jacobs sheep which was amazing! The meat was so juicy and tender. Every bite was succulent and satisfying. There was a nice accompaniment of chickpeas and greens which were perfectly cooked. Everything lay upon a beautiful sweet and slightly spicy jus. At the end of the meal I got some more bread just to soak up every bit that was left.\n\nI also got to try the braised beef shins which were practically falling apart because it was so succulent. Beautiful creamy mashed potatoes on the side as well.\n\nFinally we got the chocolate mousse for dessert which was nice but I wouldn't come back for it.\n\nOverall it was amazing and very memorable. Literally making my mouth water thinking about having it again soon.",

Service was welcoming and they did this cool thing where they brought the menu to us on a blackboard. It's written on a black board because it changes daily. Server came round to explain the specials and then take our order.\n\nI started off with the crab soup. I've never had it before but it was lovely. It had a nice sweet oceanic flavour throughout. I have to say that it had more of a brothy texture than a soupy one. One of the best things about the soup was the side of rouille! Amazing deep and strong flavours from the garlic.\n\nThen I got the Braised Beef Cheeks which were fantastic. Extremely juicy and so tender that they were practically falling apart. The sauce had a lovely sweetness to it and it was so good that after the meal I scooped up the rest with some of the bread provided. I also loved having the shallots as they had soaked up all of the rich flavours from the sauce.\n\nI can't wait to come back here to see more dishes and try new things.",

The staff are very warm, friendly and helpful.\n\nI've gotten the soup both times and both times they were delightful. Very flavorful and wholesome. There was also some decent bread served up with it.\n\nFirst time I came here, I got one of the sharing boards and it was awesome! Everything on the platter was so superb and delectable. The steak was perfectly cooked and tender. The ribs were meaty with a lovely sweet BBQ sauce on top. The prawns had a great grilled taste to them. Lovely crispy chips the first time around. If you order this you'll need to go with a big appetite just so that you can eat everything because I think you'll definitely want to.\n\nNext time round I got the steak frites from the lunch menu. Fries this time round weren't as crispy as the first time round but were still very nice. The steak pieces were fantastic again. Perfectly cooked and extremely moreish.\n\nI highly recommend going here!",

        "Review Comment": "TASTY SUSHI\n\nCame here on a Wednesday evening at around 7pm with a reservation for 2. It was quite busy and so the reservation was definitely needed. All the staff were nice and the service was rapid.\n\nIt's a cool looking restaurant and I liked that they had an anime theme within it.\n\nTo start, I got the prawn gyoza which were solid. It had a satisfying bite to it and decent texture to the wrap. There was a lovely flavour of soy sauce running over all the gyoza.\n\nThen I moved on to the best part of the meal which was the sushi. Each piece was great as they had a fulfilling mouth feel and fresh taste. I thoroughly enjoyed the eel as it had an amazing sweet smokey taste in every bite. I loved the wasabi as well. It had a wonderful sharp heat that  paired well with the soothing tastes of the sushi.\n\nIf I go back I will definitely order twice as much sushi instead of the chicken ramen or chicken donburi. I personally wasn't a fan of either of those dishes as the ramen was closer to a chicken soup and then donburi was a little bland for me. On the other hand the miso soup was too salty for my tastes.\n\nSushi was lovely and I look forward to getting a bigger platter!",

The staff were really friendly and were quick to take our orders and bring them out.\n\nI got the G-Funk burger. Really good! The pattie was cooked to perfection. The bun was good quality and the burger was the right size. I immensely enjoyed the BBQ sauce within which gave a great sweet flavour throughout.\n\nThe picante fries were great as well, having a great crisp and hint of spice to it.\n\nNice place to grab a burger, fries and a drink.",

Even though we arrived a little early the staff were nice enough to accommodate us. Whilst we were there, they were busy so we had to flag down the staff a couple of times or we would have been waiting a while. I would say that the service could be a little better if they came by more often to check and follow up.\n\nI got the soup of the day for starters which was tomato soup and it was splendid. Packed with flavour and had great consistency.\n\nFollowing that I got the roast which was awesome. The beef was succulent and delicious. All the trimmings were excellent including the sauteed greens and the roast potatoes were spectacular. Really crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I could have had 20 of them.\n\nIt would have been ideal to have a little pot of gravy to pour.\n\nThen for dessert I got the crème brûlée which had a lovely light vanilla flavour that balanced out quite nicely with the rich cream.\n\nIt was a really great meal and I look forward to coming back after a hike up Arthur's seat!",

        "Review Comment": "SUPREME DINING EXPERIENCE\n\nI was gifted the set lunch menu for two here and was able to book two days beforehand. The whole calendar looked full for a while so I wasn't sure if I just got lucky or if they release a couple of tables closer to the actual date. I got a table for 12:15 on a Thursday. The staff throughout the meal were attentive and considerate. Everytime a dish was placed on the table, the server gave a concise description of the dish, listing each ingredient. It's nice to have some context of the meal and to see the kitchin's philosophy of nature to plate become apparent.\n\nOne thing that I enjoyed immensely were the small dishes given, starting off with a mini seafood quiche which tasted fresh and salty. Then the bread and butter was given out which just had that high quality feel and taste about it. To top it all off there was a little portion of pea soup which had some intense flavours.\n\nFor starters I had the Ox which had bone broth marmalade along with some petite legume farcis. All these dishes really bring out the tasty flavours of the vegetables. The bone broth marmalade was really cool to try.\n\nThen I had the Pithivier of Roe Deer as my main. This was amazing and had a great meaty flavour packed within.\n\nTo finish off I had the Chocolate pannacotta. The sweetness of the chocolate and the taste of the berries within balanced nicely. The bay leave ice cream on the side was fantastic as well.\n\nEverything in the meal was portioned extremely well and my appetite was completely satiated at the end of the meal. The highest quality ingredients were used and you could really tell that you were getting the best at every stage of the meal.",

There was a little bit of a wait each time but there was always a table available.\nThe service is incredibly quick and very friendly.\n\nThe Black Tonkatsu Ramen is phenomenal. The broth is rich, salty and has a great subtle taste of garlic running throughout the dish. There are usually three juicy pieces of chashu that are in it which are nice and fatty. I love that there are whole bits of garlic in the broth. It really adds to the flavour and makes you wanna finish all the broth which I did each time.\n\nI also got the hell ramen and really enjoyed that as well. It has a great heat which is not overwhelming and combines fantastically with the taste of the broth.\n\nGreen tea was lovely.\n\nI have been multiple times and plan on going back again soon.",

It was perfectly filled and every bite was a treat.\n\nAll the sweet croissants are awesome! They are all tender and flaky on the outside and have a soft swirl of pastry and air on the inside. They are also not overpowered with the sweet fillings or coatings. You can really enjoy everything as it's perfectly balanced. I enjoyed all of them a lot but I would rank them as follows:\n\n1. Strawberries & Cream\n2. Raspberry & White Chocolate\n3. Chocolate Nutella\n4. Almond\n\nI also got the Chicken & Pesto savoury croissant, which was just as good as the sweet. Maybe even better but it could possibly just be my love of pesto talking.\n\nAll in all, you definitely need to get some croissants from here.",

It was fairly busy but there were some tables free. The table we got was a little weird as it was in the corner and not easy to get in and out of but once you're sitting you can get comfortable.\n\nI got the grilled Eel sushi which tasted amazing and hit all the right flavours. It was soft, tasty and subtly sweet.\n\nI also got the Mixed Bento Box which is good value. Loved having miso soup to accompany it. There was a range of meats in the box which included some lovely duck which was tender and fatty, chicken yakitori and two pieces of sushi which were salmon and tuna. All very delectable.",

We were greeted promptly at 7 by our guide Jackie who was super nice. She gave us tons of background information and answered all our questions.\n\nShe led us to the room and set the scene for us fantastically.\n\nThe puzzles were amazingly designed. Very logical and clever. Clues were given at appropriate moments and Jackie was very supportive of our success. There was a great sense of achievement that was gained throughout the room and everyone in our group had tons of fun.\n\nWe did the easy one and the next two rooms that are offered, are more difficult but are meant to be highly rated so I'm 💯% coming back to do them.\n\nWould recommend!!!",

They were quick to take my order and get the food out\n\nRecently for starters I got the Dumplings! I enjoyed the Kaffir Lime Broth that the dumplings were in as it was rich and creamy. I also got the Wagyu Beef Slider.\n\nThe ramen is awesome. Seriously really rich and tasty broth. You can taste the quality in the noodles, ingredients, and meat. I would recommend getting level one heat for the ramen to cut through some of the richness of the broth.\n\nReally great place with a cool vibe and I will definitely come back here!",

        "Review Comment": "PHENOMENAL RICH AND TASTY FOOD\n\nWas able to make a reservation for three people on a Monday for the evening. One of the servers at the front was quick to take us to our seats. You order through your phone by scanning a QR code and it worked fine enough.\n\nEverything was delicious, rich and full of flavour.\n\nI started off with the Philiy Cheesesteak. The tiger roll was nice and soft just allowing you to enjoy the filling. The steak pieces had a great taste and I just wish the sandwich had more of it. The cheese brought the whole thing together.\n\nThe buffalo wings were great. They honestly had that authentic North American taste and were extremely moreish.\n\nFinally, I really enjoyed the poutine as it was everything I ever wanted in a poutine. It had the legit cheese curds and gravy covering everything.\n\nLoved this place and excited to go back to try more of their food.",

There were quite a few available outside as well. The QR code for the table worked perfectly and it's very easy to order your food.\n\nThe service was rapid with everything coming out within minutes of the order being placed.\n\nI got the Chorizo breakfast. The chorizo is amazing and the richness of the meat is balanced nicely with the sweet spicy flavours coming from it as well.\n\nI always enjoy coming here and checking out the pastry selections as well.",

Service is quick and they're considerate enough to give a detailed run down of the menu when I asked.\n\nWhen I go back I'm definitely ordering the Mac and cheese starter. The cheese sauce was perfect, packed with flavour and not to heavy which makes all the difference for me.\n\nThe Kraken Tacos were really good as well. I think I'd hold off on ordering then again due to the price (and just order more Mac and cheese). But the  flavours of the squid and pesto worked really well together.\n\nI got the burger for mains and it was a good filling burger. The chips were awesome though. They're the great crispy kind of chips.\n\nWould definitely recommend going here for a great pub visit!",

The cool thing about this place is that the sandwiches change every couple of weeks so it's exciting to see whats coming out next. They also change up the sides as well.\n\nOne of the best sandwiches that came from albys imo was the Chicken Katsu Sandwich! The chicken was perfectly crispy and the sauce was just perfect.\n\nHowever, all the ingredients are high quality and you can really taste that extra bit. The bread used for the sandwiches are amazing as well.\n\nIf you manage to get to eat inside you'll see that all the staff are super nice and accommodating.\n\nI grab sandwiches from here all the time so I highly recommend doing the same!",

The staff were super friendly and offered great suggestions for starters and mains.\n\nThe food here was pretty good. I got the houmous which was quality cause it tasted perfectly. I'd probably skip out on the Moroccan meatballs next time though. Didn't really standout.\n\nFor mains I got the chill gosht kebab. It was a decent sized portion. Not to chilli and was very tender and tasty meat. The okra was a nice side dish as well.\n\nThe shisha part of the restaurant wasn't as good though. The staff never refilled our coals and it was a little difficult to get there attention. The shisha itself was fairly decent but would have been way better with consistent replenishments of coal.",

It wasn't too busy and there were tables around free so you could probably walk in around that time.\n\nStarted off getting the Haggis Spring Rolls because they seemed interesting. They were nice and crispy. The Haggis filling was quite good as well. It was good to try but I won't order this one again.\n\nThe battered Haddock was classically tasty and hit the spot. It had a nice crispy skin. The chips were thick, crunchy and plentiful.\n\nThe dessert platter was okay but I probably wouldn't order this again. Everything was a little to sweet.\n\nEverything was solid but I would probably order a different starter and dessert. Would definitely go back to get some proper fish and chips though!",

All together I probably waited about 20-25 minutes but it was completely worth it.\n\nThey're were only 3 options which I kinda like in a menu because that means that they probably do those three options really well. They had the chicken doner kebab, the vegetarian kebab, and the chicken kebab wrap. I got the chicken doner kebab and the wrap.\n\nBoth come to 9.80 euros which is decently priced for what you get.\n\nThe bread of the chicken doner is crispy and light. The meat is tender and flavorful. The vegetables really add a lot of textures and a sweetness to the doner. And the sauce and cheese ties it all together quite nicely.\n\nIts hard to say which one is get again because I'd both of them again. If I had to choose I'd get the doner kebab because of the bread but the wrap is definitely easier to eat.",

The sprats had a great crispy texture and retained their flavours. I didn't try the salad. The hunters linguine was fantastic. It was creamy, tasty, and the hare was awesome.\n\nI had the steak frites for main and it provided  everything you could ask for in a steak and fries meal. Very satisfying to eat as the steak was juicy.\n\nFor dessert, I got the creme brulee and that was perfect as well.\n\nYou can't fault this place and I can't wait to go here again!",

It wasn't busy at all so we easily managed to get a seat.\n\nThe shisha was fairly good and cost the standard London prices. We got the Cuban mojito. It was nice to get the standard shisha in all aspects including taste and strength.\n\nThe food was the best part of the place. The mixed grill was amazing. Everything had a great spice, flavour and texture to it. It was succulent and good quality. The chilli paneer was also at the same quality.\n\nThe only thing I would say that wasn't as good as it could be was the service. The food came out quickly and our order was taken pretty quickly.  However a lot of the time, we had to track down a server to either replace our coals, order more drinks or move inside.\n\nThat being said will definitely come back for the food!",

        "Review Comment": "AMAZINGLY TASTY AND UNIQUE ICE CREAM\n\nThis is highly recommended to me by a lot of people and for good reason.\n\nSo right off the bat you're given a range of different flavours to choose from. On the particular day that I went you were able to choose Olive oil and Oregano flavoured ice cream which I of course I had to try due to how strange it sounded. It was tasted weird at first but grew on me with each spoonful. There was a definite subtle olive taste throughout which was pleasantly welcomed each time I tasted it. It was quite good but I will probably won't order it a second time round.\n\nI went on a Sunday at around 3:30 and there was a handful of people in the queue so was waiting for around 15 minutes\n\nIts reasonably priced and I will definitely come back again!",

        "Review Comment": "FANTASTIC FOOD AND SERVICE\n\nWe were able to get a table on a Saturday night at around 7:30. I feel that this place would usually be busy, however there were a few cancellations of reservations this night.\n\nFirstly, everyone that was working here was friendly and ready to help. They gave great recommendations and were overall fantastic at getting the table what we needed.\n\nI was able to try multiple starters which were the homemade humous, the gnocchi, and the kofta. All of them are solid choices however the kofta was pretty amazing and they had a banana chutney that I've never had before but added a nice sweetness to the dish.\n\nI got the courgette wraps for mains. The dish is truly made with the pesto and beetroot chickpea purée. You definitely need one or the other in each bite to carry the dish. Also highly recommend if you love some potato.\n\nOrdered the desert to share for two people which had a range. All of them were good. Probably would have ordered the apple tart by it self because that was the best for me.\n\nReally good!",

Never seen so many deliveroo drivers congregating in the same area.\n\nGot the waffle which tasted fairly sweet but was quite thick and heavy. Personally, I needed to share this with someone to finish the waffle. The waffle was a decent base for the ice cream, toppings and sauce. Highly recommend the salted caramel ice cream.\n\nWhat's great about this place is the vast selection of different ice cream, the various cakes and pastries, the smorgasbord of different toppings, and the decent prices. Its awesome that you can personalize your dessert to quite a high degree.\n\nIt's a great place if you need a big hit of sugar and just sugar!",

The tomato sauce is strong and flavourful. The basils fresh and the all the toppings worked so well together.\n\nThey have some really great cocktails such as the espresso martini and the charismatic alchemist.\n\nThe service was great as well.

Didn't wanna wait that long so came back to the place around 11:45 and only had to wait about 10 mins to get a table.\n\nThe service here is really friendly and accommodating. they really make sure that you are acknowledged and give you a realistic time of when you will get a seat.\n\nI got the recommended waffles with strawberries, bacon and maple syrup and I got to say that these were some of the best waffles I've had. Everything worked so well together. The taste of the strawberries, sweetness of the syrup and saltiness of the bacon all balanced each other out so nicely and nothing was too overpowering.\n\nThe waffles were also light and fluffy! I didn't have that lethargy after eating which is a sign of a great meal.\n\nIf you get a chance to go here for breakfast, you must do it!",

Make sure to bring cash as they don't take card here.\n\nStarted with the Hell Pork Ramen which fairly good. It has a creamy taste however the flavours from the meat don't come through in the broth. I thought it would be spicier but there was only a mild spice from it. Still a good ramen to fulfill any need for ramen.\n\nThe sushi Tempura set was amazing. The whole set was quite filling and it was put together fantastically. It tasted perfectly but the most important thing was that the textures were very pleasant.\n\nThe sushi is of course quite expensive which is why I begin saying that you should most definitely come in a group so you can share a set and save on costs.\n\nWould come again!",

Almost everyone I got up to get another plate of food, my previously used plate was already taken.\n\nThe best way I can describe the food is that it was like having takeaway Chinese food but being allowed to have as much as you want.\n\nEverything tasted rather good and exactly what you expect from the dishes you choose.\n\nThe reason I would go back here, would be that it's great quality for quite a reasonable price. It's buffet food at the end of the day so go in with reasonable expectations.",

There's quite a relaxed vibe in this place as we just walked in and were casually able to take a seat.\n\nThe waiter was a really nice guy and was quick with  taking our order and serving food.\n\nNot sure if they change up the menu, but the desserts we got were really good. We got the apple tart which was nice. It had a great balance of flavours as the sweetness was balanced with the taste of the apple.\n\nThen we got the chocolate pistachio pot dessert which was pretty good. This one definitely needs to be shared because there is so much sugary goodness in this dish from the ice cream, to the cream, to the chocolate within the pot. The pistachios were a nice touch as they gave the dish some crunch.\n\nFor desserts from a hotel restaurant on the weekday, they were pretty good.",

It was still a decent burger but it wasn't thick enough to give a good bite to the burger. If I go again I will definitely get a different burger with a thicker burger patty.\n\nThe other person in my party got the pulled lamb burger which tasted really good!\n\nThe grilled chicken poutine was great as well. However the chicken was a little dry on the inside so I would probably order a different variety of poutine next time as well.\n\nOverall it was good but it didn't live up to the hype for me. I might have just ordered things that I didn't personally like so next time I go, I will definitely try some others.",

        "Review Comment": "GREAT ATMOSPHERE WITH GOOD FOOD\n\nWas taken here on a Friday evening a couple days after new years. Arrived at around 7:30pm and there were a lot of tables available. Started getting a lot busier later on.\n\nI got the Colonel Chipotle burger which was recommended by one of the staff. It came with chips and coleslaw. Both were great quality and very more-ish. The burger was pretty good but honestly I like the sides a lot more. The burger patty was a little to thick for me. Still tasted great!\n\nThe atmosphere is probably the best part of this place. It's in the sweet spot where it wasn't too busy or too quiet.\n\nThey're also looked like there was a lot of events going on which I need to go back for!\n\nWould recommend going here if you're looking for a place with a decent meal and great atmosphere.",

        "Review Comment": "CLASSICALLY GREAT TASTING CURRY\n\nCame here on a Wednesday at around 2pm and there were plenty of seats available. It was also new year's Day so was thankful that it was open. About 30 minutes later it got quite busy.\n\nYou are able to sit wherever as it setup with communal style seating. There are long tables with plenty of seats around.\n\nAt the back of the restaurant is the place to choose and collect your food. It's served canteen style and you're able to see exactly what you're getting.\n\nI got the pilau rice, the chicken curry, the vegetable curry, and the samosas. They are very generous with the portions when dishing out the food.\n\nThe best thing about the food for me was that it tastes rich and familiar. Everything tastes exactly like it should and all the dishes work well together which means you could go back and have a completely different combination of dishes.\n\nLovely comfort food which I will be going back for!",

        "Review Comment": "SUPERB FOOD WITH A GREAT UNDERLYING SPICE\n\nQueues started to form for this place just after we arrived at around 5:30pm on Boxing Day.  We were able to be seated immediately but groups definitely had to wait a little if they arrived after 6pm.\n\nThe service isn't bad at this place and the food came out quickly. You may however need to be a tad assertive and grab a waiters attention to order your food which is no big deal and a common theme when dining in Chinatown.\n\nAll the dishes ordered were great quality and delicious. We started off with the classic peking aromatic duck with pancakes. Everything about it  was spot on!\n\nAfterwards, our main dishes arrived, consisting of egg fried rice, morning glory, crispy shredded beef, the cauliflower dry hot pot, and the salt and pepper prawns.\n\nThe rice was perfect and tasted fresh. The morning glory was as expected. The beef and prawns were amazing as well, as they were full of flavour and had a lovely spiciness with every bite.\n\nThe best part was the cauliflower dry hot pot which was a new one for me and it tasted great. A lot of different flavours and spices in the pot with perfectly cooked cauliflower.\n\nWould definitely come back!",

Also be aware that sometimes there are events on in the evening which takes up a section of the place.\n\nThe service here is amazing! All the staff are super friendly and willing to help and give you recommendations for board games. If the staff knows how to play a game they'll also help you with the rules.\n\nThey have a great selection of board games! If you have no idea what to play there's a helpful board game menu to help with suggestions based on how many people are in your group.\n\nThey also serve food and drinks. Everything I've ordered has been decent quality and good value for money.\n\nGenuinely such a great place that you could spend hours at! 🔥",

Such a dangerous drink because it's tasty and so easy to drink.\n\nWe were also given little snacks 😍\n\nCome here if you want high quality and tasty drinks!",

I've been to other branches of this restaurant but this is my favourite one just because of how much space this one has. Also if you sit at the counter you can actually see the chef preparing different dishes which is interesting to see.\n\nThe other good thing about this place is that you know that you'll be getting decent ramen. The broth is full of flavour and I would happily have it by itself. The pork is always tender and more-ish.\n\nI tried the pumpkin croquettes which were fantastic.\n\nWould 💯 % come back here!",

The prices are really reasonable. The shared platter for two was around £20 and you get a good amount of food, dessert , and a drink.\n\nThe shared platter was great.

There was luckily a table available for us.\n\nI got the sticky toffee pudding and it was amazing! The cake was soft and had a nice bite. The sauce was sweet and worked so well together with everything.\n\nI need to go back for an actual meal cause if it was anything like dessert then its going to be awesome!",

The baristas were super friendly to me as  I entered.\n\nI got a flat white and an almond croissant. The croissant was perfectly sweet and crunchy! The coffee was super good as well. Theres a large selection of chocolates that needs to be tried so I definitely need to come back for them at some point.\n\nThe best part about this place is in my opinion the friendly and chill atmosphere.\n\nHighly recommend this place!

Our waitress said there was a delivery happening really soon but we decided to order without that.\n\nDecided to try the special which was a salmon linguine and it was great! The dish had a lovely creaminess to it and the sauce tasted great.\n\nThe desserts were also awesome! They were probably the best part of the meal! The profiteroles had the sweetest and tastiest cream!\n\nThere's also a nice view of the bridge if you're by the window.\n\nDefinitely coming back here!",

Everything by itself was quite tasty and it all worked well together.\n\nThe french toast was surprisingly good as well.

Everything served was quite good however there were a few things that were not amazing. The scrambled eggs that I got were a little watery which made them lack a little taste. The potato scone was also not that fresh. The good thing about this dish is that you get a juice and coffee/tea included in the price.\n\nI also got the pancakes with caramelized banana and  butterscotch. They were pretty nice and had a nice sweetness. They serving was the perfect amount",

We had to wait a few minutes for the kitchen to transition from serving brunch to lunch so might wanna come here a little after 1 to avoid that wait. However the food came out quickly after we ordered it.\n\nThe Vietnamese Loaded fried were awesome! The hoisin sauce worked so well with the fries and made them extremely moreish. This provided a great combination of crunchy and sweet.\n\nThe No-Fish and Chips was super close to tasting like fish and chips and it was rather tasty as well. The banana blossom replicated the taste and texture of fish extremely well.\n\nHighly recommend this place to anyone!",

I went at 12 on a Thursday and it was fairly empty and the service was very quick.\n\nFirstly, the homemade bread was amazing! It tasted fresh and the butter was an equally tasty.\n\nFor starters I got one of the soups of the days which was a beef broth. Very flavoursome and has a nice hint of horseradish throughout to give it a little something extra.\n\nFor mains I got the Roast Pork Belly which was cooked perfectly with its crispy skin and tender meat. The bubble and squeak worked very well with the dish as well and it left me wanting more.\n\nI finished with a sticky toffee pudding which was also fantastic. It was just the right amount of sweetness!\n\nIt was moderately priced and I will definitely go back again soon!",

And there was some pleasent ambient music in the background. Overall great setting for a Japanese meal.\n\nThere was a complimentary starter which was a spring roll with a little salad and it set a great tone for the rest of the meal. There was a nice hint of wasabi in the salad dressings which gave the flavours a huge lift.\n\nI got the seafood noodle dish and it was really good!

There was a lot of bacon!\n\nThe full breakfast wasn't as good as the quality of the pancakes. May have just been the one I got but the eggs were a little rubbery. Everything else was fine.\n\nThe service and atmosphere of this place is probably the best part. The owner is super nice and when I was there the people there were friendly.",

Cooked well with a lot of herbs.\n\nBe careful though. There are a lot of cats around that are really good at making you feel for them. One of the cats looked me in the eyes and started crying. Its hard not to give them some of your food.",

        "Review Comment": "UNIQUE BUT TOURISTY\n\nWe arrived at Chez Ali and the first thing to notice is that it's quite unorganized. You're in a group and sort of filtered into different sections but you're not led by anyone.\n\nSat down at our table, which again was very disorganized. Some tables had two people. Other tables had six. I was hoping to get a table just with my friends as a group of 4 but we were put with a couple.\n\nThe food was completely below average. The soup was under seasoned. The lamb was stringy and tough in the Tajine. My vegitarian friend was given vegetable couscous which was like most, tasteless. The dessert was just old and dry fruit and there was some tea. Not a good meal at all!\n\nThere were dancers that danced around you're table that just looked tired. Also BEWARNED If you engage with them, they will ask you for money. Fair enough that they ask as they're probably underpaid but they were super aggressive about asking for money.\n\nThe show was quite underwhelming as well. A couple of tricks with horse riders which were not bad but it wasn't worth the trip. Everyone doing the show looked tired and worn out. Even the crowd on the night I went were over the whole performance and clapped minimally.\n\nOverall, I paid a lot of money for a meal and show that wasnt that great. Do not recommend!!!",

It's nothing fancy and provides everything you need.\n\nThey provide a 200dh taxi ride to and from the hotel. You are able to book excursions to the waterfalls and such for a reasonable price where you are also picked up from the hotel.\n\nThe staff are friendly and are willing to help with any reservations you need etc. The maids do a fantastic job at cleaning your room even taking time to straighten up shoes and toiletries.\n\nThe pool is clean and good for a dip but small and  there are only 8 or so chaise lounges for a hotel with a lot of people.\n\nThe breakfast is standard and filling and will get boring after the third time since the same things are served everyday. However there's a pancake and omelette station though which is awesome.\n\nIt can get quite busy at times, especially at the lifts in the morning as there can be masses of people checking in and out.\n\nOverall the staff are nice, the hotel is located fairly centrally ( good resteraunts around the area and a 35 minute to the souk ), and you get all that you need.",

Our server was very helpful with recommendations and with helping my vegitarian friend choose dishes that were suitable for himself (which was a large portion of Thai Rice).\n\nWe got the set Tapas menu which was pretty good. Just about enough for four people to start of with and each dish was equally delicious. I got the chicken Penne which was amazing. Very tasty and full of flavours. Probably one of the tastiest things I've had in Marrakech and it wasn't even Moroccan food 😂\n\nThis is quite a pricey establishment though.

Nicely seasoned and had a lot of flavours in the dish. The vegetables were cooked perfectly and still retained their unique taste whilst also mixing with the other vegetables.

It was pretty good.\n\nThe lamb was tender but the aubergine didn't really add a lot to the dish and just felt unnecessary.\n\nOne of the best parts of the meal was the starter which was the pidgeon pie. It was the perfect balance between sweet and meat flavours. The crispiness added a lot of depth to the dish.\n\nThe decor of the place is probably the best part.

There's decent food (Not the best for vegitarian as they're aren't any legit vegitarian options). They give you quite a big portion when you order the burger. It was pretty good.\n\nThe shisha was quite nice as well and the drinks were alright.\n\nEveryone was nice and friendly.",

Super accomodating and helpful with picking food.\n\nThe Moroccan tea was amazing and full of flavour.\n\nI got the mixed Shawarma which was solid. Great and tasty portions of meat.  Nice bed of rice. Good and salted chips. And the salad was quite tasty as well. Perfect size for a meal that hit the spot after arriving in the country.\n\nFairly cheap as well 😁",

One for the breakfast service and one for dinner and both times have been awesome!\n\nEverything in the full Scottish breakfast is great on its own. The eggs are perfect, the bacon's the right amount of crispy, and the hash browns are outstanding! There is quite a big portion of beans though and a lack of bread.\n\nFor dinner I had the salad which was pretty good but the steak was the winner! It was nicely seasoned and very tasty! Just a really good steak!\n\nThe service was also amazing both times. The staff were attentive and friendly!\n\nSuch a great place and I highly recommend it!",

The RIBS were really tasty as well.\n\nWe also shared the aubergine and prawn Tiger gyozas which were great.\n\nI loved the CHICKEN BOA at this place. It's got the right amount of spice and flavour.\n\nSERVICE\n\nThe server was nice and friendly. He was also great with the recommendations.\n\nATMOSPHERE\n\nThis place is quite small and cosy.

        "Review Comment": "GREAT HOUMOUS\n\nI always judge a Turkish place by their houmous. Maybe not the best way to do it but it's usually a good indicator. The houmous at this place is amazing and pretty fresh! It has mixed vegetables on the top and it comes with excellent bread. It was so good that I got two portions!\n\nWe also got the mixed meat platter for one which is in the pic. Great succulent and tasty pieces of meat with a balancing rice.\n\nThe service was quick and friendly.\n\nGot the kunufeh for dessert which was pretty good. Not 100% what it's meant to taste like but it tasted good. It's quite a heavy dessert so try not to go overboard.",

Tight and close tables.\n\nFOOD\n\nWe started off with the bread salad. The bread in the place is fantastic and fresh. It was a good starter.\n\nThen we got the seafood platter which was the best seafood I've had in Edinburgh. Everything was amazing. There were prawns, mussels, and great broth. It wasn't too salty, you could still taste the essence of the seafood and it was very moreish. The broth was so good that I had to ask for more bread to have it by itself.\n\nFor mains, I got the aubergine pasta which was pretty good and then chocolate mousse for desert. All great but the seafood platter was the best.\n\nPRICE\n\nQuite pricey but honestly not too bad for three people however it could easily get up there with drinks which I didn't order",

The chicken was kinda plain and it was just bread and dips. The calamari was also kinda tasteless. It wasn't bad but considering the price I would say that its not really worth it.\n\nSPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE\n\nI just got a classic here and again it was just alright. Not the best but it wasn't bad\n\nSERVICE\n\nAgain the service was okay but it was a little slow at some points and the food took just a bit too long to come out but nothing terrible.\n\nIts just your average Italian restaurant.",

It was tasty and filling.\n\nGot the firecracker as well which is always killer but I love the spice!\n\nAnd a myriad of desserts.

Six wings are given in each dish so we all had 2 wings from each dish. This was awesome as we were able to try a selection of wings.\n\nThe wings were super tasty and the hot ones were fairly spicy.\n\nThe wait was a little long so either make a reservation or be prepared to wait.\n\nTheres a lot to say about how great this place is but you should just go and find out for yourself 😁",

        "Review Comment": "The wait for this place is pretty long taking about 30 mins to get inside the resteraunt and then another 20-30 to go from the bar to a table. The staff are super friendly to you offering you chai and lemonade in the line. Get the chai btw.\n\nThis place has some of the best service I've seen from an establishment. It varies from place to place and for obvious reasons. But on the whole it's consistently good.\n\nThe food was really good except they ran out of cheesy toast which is one of my favourites. The other classic I get would be the Pau Bhaji which is always great. Tried the Okra fries which were pretty good.\n\nThe mains were decent which included the standard chicken tikka, garlic naan, and chili prawns. Everything was tasty, and had a decent amount of spice to it. I still haven't figured out the best dishes to order. They're good but I wouldn't order them again because I feel like there's something better.  The house dhaal is super good as well.\n\nThe chocolate pudding was great as well. Very rich though.\n\nDefinitely would go again and I want to go soon. When I got the bill I was expecting the worst but with some drinks, food and dessert the overall cost of the meal was pretty average.",

I feel like this would be better as a whole go up to the bar to order food and drinks kinda place. Because it took a fair bit of time to get our orders, for food to be served and for the check to be given.\n\nI ordered the nachos and lamb flatbread. The nachos were decent and had a good amount of nachos, side things and cheese. The lamb flatbread which is one of the more expensive things on the menu wasn't that good in my opinion. The lamb didn't taste of much and it kinda felt like a more expensive kebab that you'd get on a night out. The chips were the best part of my mains.\n\nTo the credit of the servers they were consistently asking if everything was okay but I'm not sure what they could have done if I said anything.\n\nThis place might be better to just get drinks at the outside bit. Won't go back for food inside.",

Both were decent but nothing to write home about. The potato soup would be worth an order if you haven't tried it before.\n\nFor mains, I got the steak on a potato cake and it was awesome. The sauce worked really well with the steak. Highly recommend getting this if you go here.\n\nWent on a weekday for lunch and it wasn't that busy. Was looking to order their specials but they don't offer them till after 3pm.\n\nFor dessert, I got the flourless chocolate cake and it was pretty good as well. Good to finish with.\n\nOverall this place was excellent!",

The food was decent and I probably would have ordered something different cause my shawarma was exclusively nest with very little bread on the side which I think is what it needed.

You just need to make sure that you are ordering the right thing.\n\nOrder a portion of regular or sticky rice so that way you can get unlimited rice.\n\nThe menu changes quite frequently I believe so I would recommend going for something hot and something that has some sauce on it because you're guaranteed something that will be tasty and you can add the sauce to your rice.",

For a central restaurant the prices were quite good due to there lunch special. And for that price you get some really nice food. On that day I got the onion soup which wasn't I wasn't a fan of. But I also got some steak and chips, and that was really tasty.\n\nThe only downside though was that the food took a while to come out because it was a little busy. The server apologised and it wasn't too big a deal.",

The bar wasn't too busy so you could order a drink relatively easily.",

There's a waiting room which you can sit down in so it's not too bad.\n\nThe Shisha gardens themselves are very well designed and when you're at your table theres a convenient little buzzer device that allows you to let the staff know that you need coals, to order or to get the bill.\n\nThe Shisha itself was very nice and smooth. We got the berry blue drops which was great.",

Everything tasted great.\n\nThe service we got was excellent. We arrived with 5 people when we booked with 4 which I know is the worst. We didn't expect to be accomadated so well. We were just hoping that they'd squeeze in another seat but they gave us a booth which had more space.\n\nDefinelty going to come back here at some point!!!",

The deep fried chicken skins were also delicious.\n\nI also highly recommend the chocolate gyozas as they are like mini crepes filled with heaven!\n\nThe staff were extremely friendly and coped with us continuously ordering food.\n\nIf you want to eat here go at 6 as there's always a line that develops after this.",

I got the mixed sharwma which I highly recommend and the homous was also tasty which is a good indication of the place as a whole.\n\nI think the place could benefit from some fans as it can get quite hot with all the coals around.",
